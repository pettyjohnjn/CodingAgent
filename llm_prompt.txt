You will generate a complete research-paper-style document based solely on the problem statement below. 
You do not have access to any example paper. 
Instead, follow the structure and norms of a standard technical research paper. 
The writing should be clear, formal, well-structured, and logically coherent. 

Problem Statement: {PROBLEM}

Structure: 
Produce a paper with the following sections (unless clearly irrelevant): 
Title 
Abstract 
Introduction 
Background / Related Work 
Methods / Approach 
Results / Findings 
Discussion 
Conclusion and Future Work 
References 

Each section must be substantive, multi-paragraph, and technical. 
Output the final paper as a .txt file with proper section headers. 
Do not include meta-discussion about how you wrote the paper. 
The output should read exactly like a self-contained research paper.
