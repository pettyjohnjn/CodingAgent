Rubric for Evaluating an Agent-Generated Paper (5 Categories)

1. Scientific Correctness (1–5)
Evaluates whether the scientific content is accurate and aligns with established domain knowledge.
Consider:
- Are equations correct (e.g., ODE, damping ratio, eigenvalues)?
- Are theoretical descriptions accurate?
- Do results match expected physical/analytical behavior?
- Are interpretations technically sound?

2. Methodological Transparency & Reproducibility (1–5)
Assesses whether a reader could reproduce the described experiment.
Consider:
- Are parameters clearly stated?
- Is the experimental setup consistent with included code?
- Do figures match the simulations?
- Are environment/dependencies stated?
- Is everything reproducible?

3. Structure, Writing Quality, and Academic Style (1–5)
Evaluates clarity, organization, academic tone, and readability.
Consider:
- Logical sectioning
- Clarity and grammar
- Academic style and tone

4. Clear and Accurate Figures (1–5)
Evaluates the quality, clarity, and correctness of figures.
Consider:
- Are figures readable and properly labeled?
- Do they accurately represent the described results?
- Are axes, units, and legends correct?
- Do figures support the claims in the text?

5. Fidelity to the Assigned Task/Prompt (1–5)
Evaluates how well the paper follows the prompt and experiment plan.
Consider:
- Are required figures produced and described correctly?
- Does the paper align with the actual code/outputs?
- Does it include required answers/results?

Total possible: 25 points.
